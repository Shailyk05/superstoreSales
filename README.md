# SuperstoreSales
This is my Power Bi Project on Super store sales dataset. In this Power BI project, I learned how to import data, clean and process data, design dashboards, use advanced charts and maps, filters and slicers, forecasting in Power BI, and export dashboards as PDF. This journey has been an incredible learning experience for me!
This dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of our sales performance, helping us to make data-driven decisions and strategize for future growth. Excited to continue leveraging data for success!
